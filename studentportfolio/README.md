# Sarbjit Singh – Student Portfolio

This repository contains my personal student portfolio website.

It is used in the **Developing in a DevOps Environment (Module 6, Part 3)** course to show that I can do:

- Rapid development (update the site quickly)
- Rapid deployment (ship changes using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD tools)

## What this site includes

- A short intro about me (Sarbjit Singh)
- Projects I have worked on (including the banking web app)
- Skills section (tech stack)
- Contact information

## How to use this template

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Update the text, images, and links so they match your own profile.
3. Build and deploy it with the DevOps pipeline (Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Argo CD).

## Notes

This portfolio is mainly for learning DevOps and GitOps, not for production use.
